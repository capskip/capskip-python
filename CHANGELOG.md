# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- **hCaptcha support** via `hcaptcha(sitekey, url, **kwargs)` on both `CapSkip`
  and `AsyncCapSkip`, following 2Captcha's signature. Checkbox, invisible and
  hCaptcha Enterprise widgets all use this one method.
- Optional parameters: `invisible` (`1` or `True` for an invisible widget),
  `data` (the Enterprise `rqdata`), `userAgent` / `useragent`, and `proxy`.
- The result carries the token as both `code` and `token`, `respKey` (always
  present, empty when the widget handed out none) and `userAgent`, the
  User-Agent the token was earned with. Polled results now carry a `respKey`
  field whenever the server sends one.

### Notes

- Refused locally, before a round-trip: a missing sitekey, a page URL that is
  missing or not an absolute http(s) address, an `invisible` value other than
  0/1/true/false, and any parameter the CapSkip hCaptcha API does not take
  (2Captcha's `domain` among them).
- `invisible` is sent as `1`, or left out when off, so a Python `True` never
  reaches the server as the string `True`.
- hCaptcha uses `recaptchaTimeout`: the widget is passed in a real browser.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-11-02

### Added

- **DataDome support** via `datadome(captcha_url, pageurl=None, userAgent=None,
  proxy=None, **kwargs)` on both `CapSkip` and `AsyncCapSkip`, covering both
  DataDome challenges: the slider (`/captcha/`) and the device check
  (`/interstitial/`). The argument order is 2Captcha's, so code written against
  it keeps working, but `userAgent` and `proxy` are optional here; `url` is
  accepted for `pageurl` as on every other method.
- The result carries the cookie twice: `code` exactly as DataDome set it,
  attributes included, and `cookie`, the `datadome=...` pair alone for a Cookie
  header. `userAgent` is the User-Agent the cookie was earned with, the one sent
  or CapSkip's own browser's.
- `proxy` in the result: when a task is sent without a proxy and the CapSkip app
  solves it through its own DataDome proxy list, the result names that proxy as
  `host:port`. The cookie only works from that address, so it is reported
  rather than dropped. Polled results now carry a `proxy` field whenever the
  server sends one.
- Parameter aliases `captchaUrl` / `captchaURL` for `captcha_url`.

### Notes

- Refused locally, before a round-trip: a `captcha_url` that is not an https
  challenge address on captcha-delivery.com carrying `initialCid`, `hash` and
  `cid`; a block page that bans the requesting address (`t=bv`); a `pageurl`
  that is not http(s); and a `userAgent` that is not stock Chrome for Windows.
  CapSkip itself checks that the Chrome major version matches its browser and
  answers `ERROR_WRONG_USERAGENT` when it does not.
- DataDome uses `recaptchaTimeout`: the challenge is passed in a real browser.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-11-01

### Added

- **AWS WAF CAPTCHA support** via `amazon_waf(sitekey, iv=None, context=None,
  url=None, **kwargs)` on both `CapSkip` and `AsyncCapSkip`. The argument order
  is 2Captcha's, so code written against it keeps working, but only `sitekey`
  and `url` are required: on a challenge page `iv` and `context` may be left out
  and CapSkip reads them from the page at solve time. Optional
  `challenge_script` and `captcha_script` take the page's challenge.js and
  captcha.js URLs; `jsapiScript` takes a widget page's jsapi.js URL.
  The answer is a pair, not a token: the result expands into `captcha_voucher`
  and `existing_token`, which the site's own `voucher` endpoint trades for the
  `aws-waf-token` cookie. `code` keeps the raw answer.
- Parameter aliases `challengeScript` for `challenge_script`, `captchaScript` for
  `captcha_script`, and `jsapi_script` for `jsapiScript`.

### Notes

- Refused locally, before a round-trip: an `iv` without `context` or the other
  way round, a `pageurl` that is not http(s), and any script URL that is not
  https on an awswaf.com host. CapSkip POSTs the answer to the host those
  scripts name, so it refuses any other.
- AWS WAF uses `recaptchaTimeout`: a real browser mints the token the voucher is
  issued for.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-22

### Added

- **Capy Puzzle support** via `capy(sitekey, url, **kwargs)` on both `CapSkip`
  and `AsyncCapSkip`. The site key (conventionally prefixed `PUZZLE_`) is sent as
  the `captchakey` the API documents. Optional `api_server` selects the Capy API
  the key lives behind, defaulting to `https://jp.api.capy.me`.
  A Capy answer is **not a token**: the result expands into `captchakey`,
  `challengekey` and `answer`, which go into the target form's `capy_captchakey`,
  `capy_challengekey` and `capy_answer` fields. `code` keeps the raw answer.
- **CaptchaFox support** via `captchafox(sitekey, url, **kwargs)`. The result
  exposes `token` (for the form's `cf-captcha-response` field) and, when the
  solve reported one, `userAgent` — the UA the browser actually minted the token
  under, which is not the one you sent. Optional `api_server` selects the widget
  source; the MAM package returns a `MAM_` prefixed token.
- **Friendly Captcha support** via `friendly_captcha(sitekey, url, **kwargs)`.
  Pass `version` (`v1`/`v2`, or a bare `1`/`2`), or `module_script` /
  `nomodule_script` with the widget script URLs and let CapSkip read the version
  off the build the site actually loads. Optional `api_server` accepts `global`
  (the default), `eu`, or a full URL for the data-residency tenant. The result
  exposes `token`, for `frc-captcha-solution` on v1 or `frc-captcha-response` on
  v2.
- Parameter aliases `userAgent`/`user_agent` for `useragent`, `captchaKey` for
  `captchakey`, and `moduleScript`/`nomoduleScript` for `module_script` /
  `nomodule_script`.

### Notes

- `version="avatar"` is refused locally for Capy. CapSkip solves the puzzle
  family only, and answering an avatar request with a puzzle answer would bill
  for a solve the target site rejects, indistinguishably from a broken solver.
- An unknown Friendly Captcha `version` is refused locally too. The two versions
  are different protocols sharing one sitekey namespace, so solving the wrong one
  returns a well-formed token the site rejects with nothing to indicate why.
- CaptchaFox and Friendly Captcha use `recaptchaTimeout`: the first is a real
  browser solve, and the second has its difficulty set per request by the service
  (and always solves in a browser on v2). Capy uses `defaultTimeout` — it is one
  HTTP fetch plus pixel math, held back to roughly two seconds because Capy
  refuses answers that arrive faster than a human could have produced them.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- **ALTCHA support** via `altcha(url, **kwargs)` on both `CapSkip` and
  `AsyncCapSkip`. Pass `challenge_url` for CapSkip to fetch the challenge, or
  `challenge_json` with the document itself (a JSON string, or a `dict` which is
  serialized for you). Sending both is allowed — the inline document wins. The
  result exposes `token` (the value the site's `altcha` form field expects) and
  `number`, the counter that solved it; `code` keeps the same raw string.
- Parameter aliases `challengeUrl`/`challengeURL` for `challenge_url` and
  `challengeJson`/`challengeJSON` for `challenge_json`.
- Both ALTCHA generations are handled: the legacy scheme (SHA-1/256/384/512) and
  proof-of-work v2 (PBKDF2 or SHA). Their tokens are shaped differently — a v2
  payload carries no top-level `number`, its counter sitting at
  `solution.counter` — so the counter is taken from the server's own `solution`
  object, the one field both report the same way, and dug out of the token only
  when a poll did not carry it.

### Notes

- ALTCHA is CPU proof-of-work rather than a browser solve, so it uses
  `defaultTimeout` instead of the longer `recaptchaTimeout` that reCAPTCHA,
  Turnstile and GeeTest use.
- A proxy passed to `altcha()` applies only to the `challenge_url` fetch; a task
  carrying its challenge inline never touches the network.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- **GeeTest v3 (slide) support** via `geetest(gt, challenge, url, **kwargs)` on
  both `CapSkip` and `AsyncCapSkip`. Accepts the optional `api_server` domain
  override and the usual `proxy` parameter. The result exposes the answer as the
  parsed `challenge`, `validate`, and `seccode` fields, while `code` keeps the raw
  JSON string CapSkip returns.
- Parameter aliases `apiServer` and `api_subdomain` for `api_server`.
- `proxytype` is now validated against the values CapSkip accepts (`HTTP`,
  `HTTPS`, `SOCKS5`, `SOCKS5H`, case-insensitive) for every proxy-capable captcha
  type. `SOCKS4` and other values previously reached the server and came back as
  `ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`; they now raise `ValidationException` locally.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Submitting with `json=1` no longer fails with `ApiException: cannot recognize
  response`. With `json=1` CapSkip's `in.php` returns `{"status": 1, "request":
  "<id>"}` instead of `OK|<id>`; `send()` now parses both forms, so
  `normal(..., json=1)` and the equivalent reCAPTCHA/Turnstile calls submit and
  solve correctly. Applies to both the sync and async clients.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Polling no longer crashes with `ApiException: cannot recognize response` when
  CapSkip returns an empty response body. CapSkip returns an empty body while no
  result is available yet — briefly right after a captcha is submitted (before it
  reports `CAPCHA_NOT_READY`), for an unknown id, and after a solved token has
  already been read. The SDK now treats an empty body as "not ready" and keeps
  polling, so `recaptcha()`, `turnstile()`, and `normal()` solve reliably instead
  of failing on the first poll. Applies to both the sync and async clients.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Initial release of the CapSkip Python SDK
- `CapSkip` synchronous client for the local CapSkip API
- `AsyncCapSkip` asynchronous client (`httpx` + `aiofiles`)
- Image CAPTCHA solving via `normal()` (file, URL, base64, or data-URI)
- reCAPTCHA v2 / v3 solving via `recaptcha()` (invisible, enterprise, proxy)
- Cloudflare Turnstile solving via `turnstile()` (widget and challenge page)
- Turnstile automatically polls with `json=1` and returns `userAgent` when provided
- Manual workflow: `send()`, `get_result()`, `solve()`
- Adaptive result polling — starts at 0.25s and backs off (doubling) up to the
  configured `pollingInterval`, so fast solves (e.g. image captchas) return in a
  fraction of a second; `pollingInterval` also accepts sub-second (float) values
- Familiar parameter aliases (`url`→`pageurl`, `score`→`min_score`, etc.)
- Proxy support via dict format `{'type': '...', 'uri': '...'}`
- Strict per-captcha parameter validation — only documented parameters are accepted
- Exception hierarchy: `ValidationException`, `NetworkException`, `ApiException`, `TimeoutException`
- Example scripts for every supported captcha type
- Unit tests (sync + async) with a mocked API client
- Documentation: Tutorial, Getting Started, API Reference, Troubleshooting
