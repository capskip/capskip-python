"""Solve a CaptchaFox challenge.

CaptchaFox scores the browser itself rather than asking the visitor to read
anything, so most solves draw no puzzle at all. CapSkip drives the real widget in
a real browser and returns the verification token it would have produced.

You need two values, both read off the target page:

  * ``sitekey`` - the public key the widget renders with, conventionally
    prefixed ``sk_``. It is on the widget container as ``data-sitekey``, or in
    the ``captchafox.render(...)`` call. If the page builds the widget at
    runtime, open DevTools -> Network and find the request to
    ``api.captchafox.com``: the key is the path segment after ``/captcha/``.
  * ``pageurl`` - the full URL of the page the widget appears on

The page URL has to match: CaptchaFox keys are registered against a list of
allowed domains and the service checks the host before it issues anything. A key
that is correct but used on a page outside that list is refused permanently, not
intermittently -- so if a sitekey fails immediately and consistently, check that
you are sending the page the widget actually runs on rather than a search page,
a redirect or a shortened link.

# --- Choosing the widget source ----------------------------------------------
# CaptchaFox publishes its widget from two places, and which one a site loads
# decides the shape of the token it expects back. Send api_server only when the
# target page does not use the default (https://cdn.captchafox.com/).
#
#   result = solver.captchafox(
#       SITEKEY,
#       PAGE_URL,
#       api_server='https://s.uicdn.com/mampkg/@mamdev/core.frontend.libs.captchafox/',
#   )
#
# That one returns a MAM_ prefixed token. Read the value from the <script> tag on
# the target page: if you send the wrong one the solve still succeeds, but the
# token comes back in a format the site will not accept, which looks like a
# silent verification failure rather than an error.
#
# --- With a per-request proxy ------------------------------------------------
# CapSkip does not force a proxy, but CaptchaFox scores the network a widget runs
# on as well as the browser, so repeated solves from one address push that
# address toward the interactive challenges and then toward refusals.
#
#   result = solver.captchafox(
#       SITEKEY,
#       PAGE_URL,
#       proxy={'type': 'HTTP', 'uri': 'login:password@1.2.3.4:8080'},
#   )

# Post the token back in the form field the widget uses, named
# `cf-captcha-response`. Treat it as opaque and pass it through unchanged -- it
# is verified server side against the session that produced it, so any edit
# invalidates it.
#
#   requests.post(SIGNUP_URL, data={
#       'email': 'someone@example.com',
#       'cf-captcha-response': result['token'],
#   })
#
# Some integrations read the token from a JSON body field instead, so check what
# the page's own submit sends and mirror it.
print('Form field:', {'cf-captcha-response': result['token'][:40] + '...'})

# Submit under the User-Agent the token was minted with, not your own. CapSkip
# solves in a real browser and uses that browser's identity, so the UA it reports
# is the one the token is bound to.
#
#   headers = {'User-Agent': result['userAgent']}
#
# Tokens are short lived: submit promptly rather than holding one while a user
# fills in a form, and solve again if the form is abandoned and resumed.

# `code` holds the same string as `token`, which is what you forward if you are
# porting code written against another solver's API.
assert result['code'] == result['token']

# Two of CaptchaFox's challenge types are not solvable -- image-select and the
# audio fallback, both rare. They are reported as unsolvable rather than waited
# out, so treat a failure as a signal to resubmit into a fresh challenge rather
# than as a permanent failure of the key.
